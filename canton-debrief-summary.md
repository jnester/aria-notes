# Canton Street - Quick Debrief Points

1. Look around before speaking - assess the situation first
2. It's okay to ask dumb questions - people move on immediately  
3. Initiating doesn't cost as much as expected
4. If someone catches your eye, you can go say hi - ask to join them, introduce yourself
