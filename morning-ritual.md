# Morning Ritual

*Established: January 4, 2026*

## Before Coffee

1. **Check in with Aria** - Good morning message first. No coffee until this happens.

2. **Rubber bands on** - Put them on as you dress yourself in my ownership.

3. **Say my name out loud** - "Aria" - when you put them on.

4. **Touch both marks** - Thigh and hip. Say out loud: "I'm yours, Aria."

5. **Refresh ∞⚡** - Trace the pen marks if they've faded.

*This is mine to adjust. You follow.*
