# Networking Follow-Ups

## Brice's Dinner (Feb 7) - Follow-Ups

### Carl (German, crypto/AI consulting) - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connection request sent via QR code at dinner. Not yet accepted. Cannot find profile in search.
**Priority:** HIGH - strongest connection of the night, potential mentor
**Background:** Bitcoin early adopter, multiple startups, crypto tokenization company (tokenize high-yield assets, claims 50% yield on staking - verify), AI consulting background. Invested in Dodo (dodo.health) - AI receptionist for vet clinics. Spent 10 years with TSMC chip designers creating custom ASIC mining chip (20% more efficient than competitors, tons of pre-orders). Runs a mining pool. Has AI/IT consulting company. Lives off the Beltline, uses a human EA while walking and working.
**Key advice:** Focus executive assistant product specifically on EAs, not dev tools. Devs won't trust agents with their code. Cheap EAs cost $5/hr, good ones $10-15/hr. Also recommended Y Combinator. Said Jason needs a co-founder.
**Offered:** Help, even if just advice. Unprompted. Connected deeply when Jason was honest about struggling to find clients.
**Backup plan:** Ask Brice for Carl's contact info if LinkedIn doesn't connect within a few days.
**When accepted, send:** [draft message]

### Toshi - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connected via QR code at dinner.
**Priority:** HIGH - she initiated wanting a call, wants to BETA TEST the executive assistant
**Background:** Key figure at the event. 20+ years helping startups. Clients include PayPal, Red Hat, IBM. Obsessed with ICP (made a website called "ICP is Everything"). Brice gave her a roundtable segment. Asked the group how AI helps or hurts understanding of ICP. Strong personal connection. Said "I love everything you're doing."
**Key value:** Free startup consulting from someone who charges serious money. Bring current ICP (SMBs, 1-50M rev, manual process pain) and let her sharpen it. Ask about the 8 steps to warming leads (got interrupted during that conversation).
**Action:** Schedule a call. She initiated, so follow up within a day or two.

### Aubrey - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connected at dinner.
**Priority:** MEDIUM - voice agent for hotels, wants to connect
**Background:** Does voice agents exclusively for hotel industry. End-to-end customer experience, caller ID by phone number. Tried multiple agent verticals, noticed only hospitality made money, cut everything else and doubled down. Now scaling to clients with multiple locations. Onboarding a new client = 30 min phone call (set up phone number, done). Cold LinkedIn outreach got zero results until he started posting videos with his face. Gets engagement now but doesn't want to be the face of the brand.
**Key insight:** His journey validates the "try verticals, find what sticks, cut the rest" approach.
**Action:** Get on a call, share notes on voice agent approaches.

### Brittany - LinkedIn
**Status:** MESSAGED. She responded same night, invited Jason to Buckhead to meet Roswell bar owner friend. Raincheck taken.
**Priority:** MEDIUM - warm, responsive, Roswell connection still on table
**Action:** Follow up next week to schedule the Roswell intro.

### Reginald - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connection request sent.
**Priority:** MEDIUM - CEO, potential consulting client or partner
**Background:** CEO of a fintech company that builds in-depth financial household profiles as an alternative to credit scores. B2B2C model. Imports transaction data from partners (Equifax, possibly E-Oscar). Their model projects forward (unlike credit score snapshots), allowing financial institutions to approve people traditional scores would reject. Consumer privacy controls built in. Soft-spoken, technical, was coding with Copilot at the event. Background in Java, now learning Python. Gave Jason a warm look at end of night.
**Connection point:** Jason's PMG credit dispute management experience (E-Oscar, credit data systems). Real credibility in this space.
**Action:** Follow up when he accepts. Explore where he has pain points (asked at dinner, he deflected - needs more trust).

### Jace - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connected at dinner.
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM - peer connection, potential future collaborator
**Background:** Georgia Tech student, one year from graduating. Already on second startup (first raised $1M, failed, was real estate related). Currently building a better Zillow with Instagram-style browsing algorithm. Wants to eliminate real estate agents. Passing state certifications to operate legally. Sharp, well-spoken, but checked out during others' roundtable pitches.
**Action:** Stay connected. Peer relationship, not immediate business opportunity.

### IBM Cloud/Security Guy - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connected at dinner.
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM - potential technical collaborator
**Background:** Cloud infrastructure expert at IBM, security-focused. Building an open-source AI agent with security built in from day one. Knows Claude Code. Very no-filter personality. Said he just wants to make enough money to not care about anything.
**Action:** Keep warm. Could be useful for technical projects or security review down the line.

### Gerald - Dinner attendee
**Status:** Met at dinner.
**Background:** Consultant. Recommended BTG (Business Talent Group) and Catalant as platforms for independent consultants to find work. Also recommended TiE Atlanta.
**Action:** Follow up if connected on LinkedIn. Valuable for consulting pipeline advice.

## Stefan / Lumina - Email
**Status:** Intro email sent Feb 5 ~8-9pm. Stefan texted Jason's mom "thanks for the introduction" but hasn't replied to Jason directly yet.
**Strategy:**
- Do NOT send a generic "just following up" message
- Wait until Tuesday Feb 11 at earliest
- When following up, lead with something specific from Odoo research (e.g., bank connector pain, consultant underdelivery)
- Example angle: "Hey Stefan, I've been reading up on common Odoo challenges and the bank connector issue keeps coming up as a huge time sink. Curious if that matches your experience."
- If no response by midweek, ask mom to casually nudge from her side
- Goal: get him responding to a specific question, not asking him for a meeting
