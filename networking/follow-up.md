## Stefan / Lumina - Email
**Status:** Intro email sent Feb 5 ~8-9pm. Stefan texted Jason's mom "thanks for the introduction" but hasn't replied to Jason directly yet.
**Strategy:**
- Do NOT send a generic "just following up" message
- Wait until Tuesday Feb 11 at earliest
- When following up, lead with something specific from Odoo research (e.g., bank connector pain, consultant underdelivery)
- Example angle: "Hey Stefan, I've been reading up on common Odoo challenges and the bank connector issue keeps coming up as a huge time sink. Curious if that matches your experience."
- If no response by midweek, ask mom to casually nudge from her side
- Goal: get him responding to a specific question, not asking him for a meeting

## Gary Gillespie (ResorsIT) - LinkedIn
**Status:** Connection request sent, waiting for acceptance
**When accepted, send:**
> Hey Gary, enjoyed our conversation Tuesday night at Atlanta Tech Park. The DNS product sounds like a solid opportunity.
>
> You mentioned grabbing lunch with an AI consultant earlier that day. I'd love an intro if you think there's a fit. Either way, glad we connected.
