## Key People

### Drew (Organizer, Code Drifters co-founder, MedFlow)
- **Background:** Machine learning, even before generative AI
- **Current:** Built a medical/healthcare startup, recently closed a seed round
- **Product:** Identifies patients eligible for Medicaid-covered services that practices aren't capturing. Practices can go from processing ~20 patients/week to ~2,000/week, earning ~$200/person. Pure "make people money" play.
- **Most valuable conversation of the night.** Talked at length.

**Drew's Advice:**
- Products must either **save people money** or **make people money** — those are the only two that work
- Atlanta is a **B2B city** — almost no B2C success stories come out of Atlanta
- His co-founder talked to **300 investors** before closing the seed round (3 investors)
- **Reliability/accuracy** is the big challenge with agents:
  - 90% success rate sounds good but compounds across multi-step tasks to ~65% effective
  - Need 99%+ to be truly effective; each additional "9" is another order of magnitude of difficulty
  - He's writing a white paper on this topic
  - He's somewhat in the "AI-averse" camp — skeptical of generative AI agent hype
- **Key pivot moment:** Initially said "everyone says AI agents, that sounds generic." But when Jason explained the form factor — doing real work away from a screen — Drew said: "Actually, that's what you have. That's what nobody else is doing. I'd use that."
- Suggested **marketing as a developer tool** — developers are the biggest current agent users, they're forgiving of rough edges, and the value is immediately additive
- Said the reliability problem is **Anthropic's and OpenAI's job to solve**, not Jason's — Jason's moat is the form factor

### Jared (Organizer, Code Drifters)
- Background in history
- Grew up moving around a lot (dad was military contractor) — connected with Jason over shared experience of frequent moves as kids
- Very talkative, personable
- Doesn't like Georgia heat — wants to reach the point where he can "summer" (as a verb) somewhere else
- Wife's family is from Greece, they visit sometimes
- Really enjoyed talking to Jason — spent significant time together
- Jumped on Jason's crowdsourcing idea for the grocery girl's data problem

### Taylor (Code Drifters)
- **Director of game development and designer on the Knights of the Old Republic remake project** — Jason was following this project and was genuinely excited to meet him
- Currently working with an independent game studio on a game called **Calamity** (can't share details, NDA)
- Not his first game where he's not director
- Studio specifically avoids VR due to technical complexity
- Not on social media at all — Jason connected via email
- **Dream crushed Jason hard** — grilled the product from multiple angles:
  - People might feel AI encroaches on their egos / threatens their jobs
  - Managers using it could make employees feel replaceable
  - "You're selling a feeling, not a solution" — Jason's passion/excitement doesn't translate directly to professional value prop
  - Needs to be more specific, less generic — "sounds like every other AI product"
  - Suggested finding a niche: music + AI? Developer tool? Something focused
- **Despite all the grilling, turned around and pointed people to Jason at end of night:** "Have you guys talked to Jason? His product idea is actually pretty cool."
- **Materials/infrastructure advice:**
  - Told Jason to pay attention to **materials — specifically cobalt and water**
  - AI is centralized and subject to political regulation — Jason's entire business depends on that centralized infrastructure
  - Watch **state and local government legislation** closely
  - Used coffee analogy: you depend on coffee daily, you'd be different without it — same dependency chain exists for AI on physical resources (cobalt for chips, water for cooling data centers)
  - Advice: don't be so heads-down in the software layer that you miss the physical reality underneath; possibly invest in fundamental materials
  - Core message: know what AI depends on so you're not blindsided

### Ross (Code Drifters)
- Dream crushed hard — initially dismissive: "This doesn't sound like anything other than ChatGPT, honestly. And you know that."
- Jason pushed back: existing voice agents (ChatGPT, etc.) severely restrict tool usage and integrations, use less intelligent models to reduce latency. Jason uses top-tier models with full tool access — Claude Code, Linear, GitHub, web browser, everything
- Ross softened somewhat but was hard to read — possibly autistic or neurodivergent, came across as rude in tone/expressions even when content wasn't necessarily rude
- Asked "what else do you like to do?" — Jason initially interpreted as "you should quit this and do something else"
- Actual meaning: your product is too generic, find a niche. If you're passionate about music, maybe AI + music. Get more specific and differentiated.
- When Jason said "executive assistant for C-suite," Ross started poking holes in that too

### Brittany (Investor)
- Black woman, very warm, nice, friendly
- Works at **Google** and also does investing — connects investors with early-stage startup founders
- Helps **Series A** stage companies
- Asked Jason what funding stage he's at — he told her pre-funding, bootstrapping with consulting
- **Wants to connect Jason with a friend:**
  - Friend is literally from Roswell
  - Went to Roswell High School
  - **Owns several bars on Canton Street** — Jason's neighborhood
  - She thought they'd really connect
  - Friend was invited to the event but couldn't make it
- Connected on LinkedIn ✓

### Brice (Investor)
- Tall black guy with French accent
- Came up to Jason deliberately later in the night
- Opened with complimenting Jason's outfit: "You're dressed really well tonight"
- Asked what Jason does, heard the pitch
- **Invited Jason to a curated event on Friday** — only 13 total slots
  - Physically opened Jason's phone/LinkedIn to get him registered
  - Later checked that Jason RSVP'd — "slots are going fast, only 4 left"
  - Also invited several other people from tonight's meetup
- Told Jason there will be **businesses at Friday's event who need AI consulting**
- Asked Jason to play pool at end of night (~9pm), Jason decided to leave
- Connected on LinkedIn ✓
- Will see him again Friday

### Benny (AI Consultant)
- Asian guy
- Former **lead designer at Coca-Cola** — left because Coke wasn't adopting AI fast enough
- Now doing AI consulting — currently helping a client with AI-generated creative work (PowerPoint slides, training AI on the person's voice/style)
- **Wearing smart glasses** with a green screen displaying real-time speech transcription — Jason didn't realize at first
  - Owns **6 pairs** of smart glasses including Meta display glasses
  - These particular ones had no camera, just display
  - Rika (crypto girl) spotted them
- Potential peer connection — two AI consultants in same city, likely complementary
- Connected on LinkedIn ✓

### Rika (Crypto girl)
- Runs some kind of **delegated staking/validator node** — people delegate coins to her organization for more voting power
- "Super big brain"
- Something seemed off — possibly autistic or neurodivergent
- Spotted Benny's smart glasses
- Connected on LinkedIn ✓

### Pink-haired girl (name not captured)
- Has a full-time job, building on the side
- **Product:** Grocery price comparison — different stores have different prices for same items, but pricing data isn't available to consumers. Wants to let people build a cart and see which store would be cheapest.
- **Problem:** How to get the data without scraping (TOS violations)
- Jason suggested **crowdsourcing** — like Waze, where users report/photograph deals and sales to keep prices current
- Jared jumped on the crowdsourcing idea and ran with it
- Long-term plan is to work directly with stores
- Jason's private assessment: didn't feel like it had strong legs

## Jason's Pitch Evolution (Throughout the Night)

**Started as:** "I'm building a voice agent that does meaningful work away from your computer"
- Problem: People heard "now you can work MORE, even away from your desk"

**Refined to:** "An alternative to working at your desk — not additional work, replacement of screen time"
- Better but still somewhat abstract

**Best version (landed on by end of night):** "Voice command access to all your developer systems — Claude Code, GitHub, Linear — from your phone, while you're walking."

**Key framing insight:** "I'm a startup founder bootstrapping with AI consulting" — experienced people nodded knowingly and affirmed this is exactly the right approach

## Product Feedback Summary

### Positive Signals
- Drew: "The form factor is what you have that nobody else has. I'd use this."
- Taylor: After heavy grilling — "His product idea is actually pretty cool"
- Multiple Code Drifters members validated after dream crushing
- Two investors wanted follow-ups without Jason even seeking them out

### Critiques / Dream Crushing
- **Too generic** — "sounds like every other AI agent" (Ross, initially Drew)
- **Reliability** — 90% compounds to ~65% over multi-step tasks (Drew)
- **Latency** — using smarter models = slower responses (Drew)
- **Perception problem** — sounds like "work more" not "work better" (Taylor)
- **Ego threat** — AI tools can offend people by simplifying their jobs (Taylor)
- **No metrics** — investors need completion rates, latency numbers, user data (multiple)
- **"Selling a feeling"** — passion/excitement about the product isn't a pitch (Taylor)
- **Need a niche** — developer tool or executive assistant, not "general purpose" (Ross, Drew)

### Jason's Responses That Landed
- "Existing voice agents restrict tool usage and use dumber models. I removed all limits." (to Ross)
- "When you tell someone to go do something, it takes a second — that's not latency, that's action." (to Drew on latency)
- "The clearer you specify requirements and validation criteria, the better the AI completes to full correctness." (to Drew on reliability)

## Strategic Takeaways

### Go-to-Market
- **Developer tool first** — lowest friction, most forgiving users, already have the product
- **Pitch:** "Voice agent that lets developers manage Claude Code, GitHub, Linear — all their tools — by voice, from their phone. No screen required."
- **B2B only** in Atlanta market
- Product must **save money or make money** — frame accordingly
- Executive assistant to C-suite = bigger market, but requires more polish (future phase)

### Investor Readiness
- Currently pre-funding, bootstrapping with consulting
- Not ready for investor grilling yet — no metrics (completion rates, latency data, user sessions)
- Brittany helps Series A — future connection when ready
- Friday event: curated room of ~13, businesses needing AI consulting — focus on consulting, not product pitch

### Relationships to Nurture
1. **Drew** — strongest mentor energy, been where Jason is, gave real talk. Nurture specifically.
2. **Jared** — personal connection, co-organizer, genuine rapport
3. **Taylor** — deep thinker, game industry, respected Jason after grilling. Email connection.
4. **Brittany** — investor, Google, Canton Street friend intro. High potential.
5. **French investor** — Friday event host, sees something in Jason
6. **Benny** — fellow AI consultant, potential peer/collaborator

### Government Contracts
- Second time in two days someone mentioned gov contracts as path to AI consulting revenue
- Jason has potential Gwinnett County connection
- Pattern worth pursuing

### Materials/Infrastructure Awareness (Taylor)
- Watch cobalt supply, water usage for data centers
- Monitor state/local government AI legislation
- Know the physical dependencies underneath the software layer

## Concerns & Reflections

- **Shared too much product detail** with too many people — 6-7 people heard the full vision. Going forward: share the what, not the how.
- **Voice issues** — quiet, high-pitched, raspy. Anxiety in body. Nobody seemed to have trouble hearing him, but Jason was self-conscious about it.
- **No mentor** — feeling vulnerable in "shark-infested waters" without experienced guidance. Drew is closest to filling this role.
- **Dad's advice conflict** — Dad said don't come across technical, only business. Jason pitched as startup founder. The room responded well to founder framing, but Jason feels conflicted about going against dad's advice.
- Everyone thought Jason was in his 20s — investor guy thought he was ~22 despite 15+ years as a developer
