## How I Got Here

Met Brice Nsiangani at startup drinks downtown (Feb 4). He invited me to this curated roundtable dinner. Also met Brittney James and other investors that night.

## Event Legitimacy Assessment

### ✅ Green Flags
- **Brice Nsiangani:** Georgia Tech grad (Electrical/Computer Engineering), former AT&T Systems Engineer, French Club President at GT 2016. Legitimate professional background.
- **TechInvest DinnerGroup:** Operates in 6+ cities (Atlanta, Austin, Houston, SF, Boston, NYC)
- **Partnered with RenderATL** (legitimate Atlanta tech conference)
- **Running regularly** for months with real attendees, photos, active chat

### ⚠️ Yellow Flags
- PivoGuard website currently down (503 error)
- Meetup group page returns "not found"
- Heavy push in chat to complete "Health Checks" on PivoGuard so "investor partners can reach out" — lead-gen funnel
- Tiered membership (Pro/Advanced) = monetization angle
- Blockchain/DeFi/smart contract buzzwords in group description

### Verdict
**Not a scam, but not purely altruistic.** The dinners are a marketing funnel for PivoGuard's investor-matching platform. The networking itself is real. Don't get sucked into paying for "investor access" packages.
