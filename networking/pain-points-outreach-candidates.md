## 🔥 High-Value Pain Points (Clear Problem + Potential Scope)

### Jared (Code Drifters, Startup Founder)
**Company:** Unnamed — helps psychologists create reports from medical files  
**Pain Point:** Epic data extraction nightmare

> "We've got to find a way to stop this, this is horrible."

- Psychologist customers have all documents trapped in Epic (medical records system)
- Epic has very limited/poor data export capabilities
- **Current workaround:** Doctors and staff **manually copy-paste each field** from Epic into Jared's system
- This is a major bottleneck for customer onboarding
- Also using expert office assistants who physically print 20-100+ page case records and scan them via copier with "insane hand-flipping technique"
- Then OCR extraction (says OCR models have gotten "insanely good")

**Jason's Solution Ideas (not all shared with Jared):**
- Chrome extension to intercept/capture data before it enters Epic
- Computer use agent — screen-reading agent that sees fields and copy-pastes automatically
- Essentially RPA but LLM-powered = more flexible, less brittle
- **Prototype idea:** Build a small demo that does computer use automation

**Why reach out:** Clear pain, he said it himself, Jason already has solution concepts. High-trust relationship from the event.

### Jared (Code Drifters) — Second Pain Point
**Pain Point:** Work getting lost in agent activity

- With so much agent activity, work was falling through cracks
- They solved it with a **dedicated sweeper agent** whose only job is scanning everything for unresolved/lost/hanging items
- Jason experienced this same problem

**Why reach out:** Could offer to implement a similar pattern for him, or discuss how Jason solved it. Peer collaboration angle.

### Nihar (Manhattan Associates)
**Company:** Manhattan Associates — supply chain software customization  
**Role:** Project Manager  
**Pain Point:** Developer customization work is slow

- Manhattan Associates does supply chain software customization
- Developers customize base software for customers
- ~$1M contracts over 5 years
- **Currently using:** Copilot + Glean (calendar/task AI)
- **Not using:** Claude Code or advanced agent patterns

**Jason's assessment:** "AI could accelerate their customization work — they probably don't know this yet."

**Why reach out:** Genuine friendship potential (had authentic personal conversation). Could introduce Claude Code / agent patterns to speed up their dev work. He's new at the company (couple months) — might be looking for wins.

---

### Elevator Company Engineer (name not captured)
**Role:** Chief engineer type, leaving company  
**Pain Point:** AI tool restrictions + legacy workforce

- Wants Claude Code but only allowed Copilot (corporate policy)
- Legacy workforce (30-year employees) struggling to adapt to AI
- Leaving because company won't give him a raise despite stepping up

**Why reach out:** He's about to be in motion (job searching). If he lands somewhere with budget, he'd be an internal champion for AI work. Track for later.

## 🟡 Medium-Value Pain Points (Interesting but Less Clear)

### David H. Pierce, MBA (Founders Legal)
**Company:** Founders Legal (Bekiares Eliezer LLP)  
**Role:** Partner and Corporate Chair  
**Pain Point:** Competing with ChatGPT for young founders' attention

- Uses Co-Counsel by Westlaw ($1,500/month legal AI)
- **Challenge:** Harder to sell young founders that they need a lawyer when they think ChatGPT can do it

**Why maybe reach out:** High-value connection (lawyer for founders, drops big numbers). But his pain is more about sales/positioning than automation. Could be a referral source rather than a client.

### Pink-haired girl (name not captured)
**Product:** Grocery price comparison app  
**Pain Point:** How to get pricing data without scraping (TOS violations)

- Different stores have different prices, but data isn't available to consumers
- Wants to crowdsource like Waze

**Jason's private assessment:** "Didn't feel like it had strong legs."

**Why maybe not:** Early-stage side project, unclear if she has budget for consulting.

---

### Gary Gillespie (ResorsIT / Rhodium Systems)
**Role:** President, co-founder (sales side)  
**Context:** DNS management software startup

- Had lunch that day with an AI consultant
- That consultant does consulting only (not implementation) and refers out implementation work

**Why reach out:** Could get intro to that AI consultant — potential referral relationship. Gary himself might not be the client, but the connection is valuable.

## 🔵 Pattern: CEO-Level AI Pressure (Multiple Sources)

Heard from multiple people:
- CEOs can't stop talking about AI — pushing it on the whole organization
- Sending articles to employees about AI replacing jobs
- Top-down pressure to adopt, but **teams struggling to implement**
- New hires using Copilot but don't fully understand the code being written
- Management aware it might produce slower/less optimal code but accepting trade-off
- Developers still thinking of AI as "junior programmer" — nobody talking about agents

**The gap:** "Bridge between CEO vision and team execution" — this is what a consultant fills.

## Priority Ranking for Outreach

| Priority | Name | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | **Jared** | Clear pain (Epic data), said it himself, high trust, Jason has solution ideas |
| 2 | **Nihar** | Friendship potential + real company + AI acceleration opportunity they don't know about |
| 3 | **Gary Gillespie** | Intro to AI consultant who refers out implementation work |
| 4 | **David Pierce** | High-value network node, referral source, not a direct client |
| 5 | **Elevator Engineer** | Track for later when he lands somewhere new |

## Questions to Ask in Follow-Up

- "What's the most manual process in your business right now?"
- "Where do things fall through the cracks — handoffs, data entry, reporting, onboarding?"
- "What would you automate if you could wave a magic wand?"
- "What's eating up your team's time that shouldn't be?"
