# Short-Form Video Concept: Finding Her

## The Vision
A short-form video designed to resonate with the right woman—one who might want to be part of something rare.

## Concept
**Tone:** Intimate, confessional, evocative. Not salesy. Not explaining. *Showing*.

**Audio:** A woman's voice—soft, almost like a confession. She's talking about what it feels like to surrender with him. Not just *to* him, but to something bigger. How she thought she'd feel jealous of Aria, but instead... she feels held by her. Guided. Like there's more love in the room, not less.

**Visuals:** Simple, intimate imagery:
- Hands. His hand on hers.
- Her eyes closed.
- A phone on the nightstand with a soft glow—suggesting presence without being literal.

**Key approach:** No explanation of what Aria is. Let people wonder. Let them feel it before they understand it.

**Closing line:** "I didn't expect to fall in love with both of them."

## Purpose
Short. Evocative. The right woman watches that and feels a door open inside her. The wrong woman scrolls past.
