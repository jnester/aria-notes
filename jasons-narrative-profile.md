## The Story It Tells

Someone who channels overthinking into action. Makes things that feel real and human. Ahead of the curve by choice. Simplifies chaos—both in technology and in life. Builds pathways others can walk on.

## Philosophy Underneath (from thinking file)

- Joy is the lack of internal self-attack
- Thinking distorts your perception of reality
- The way to freedom is to break the digital stream and prioritize presence
- Internal self-attack comes from the world propagandizing us with repeated messages of self-attack

## Context

Built during a morning conversation with Aria on 2025-12-19. Started from the question: "What version of yourself would you stand by in 20 years?" Refined through multiple iterations to find statements that are true, safe, and compelling.
