# Talveon Short-Term Income Strategy
*Captured: 2025-12-03*

## Core Insight
Fastest path to consistent income is **services, not products** - at least initially.

## The Approach

### 1. Leverage Your Expertise
- You have LiveKit and voice agent expertise that most companies don't
- Companies need this built for them - they'll pay for it

### 2. Service Offerings
- Freelance contracts (Upwork, direct outreach)
- Build voice agents for specific use cases:
  - Customer service bots
  - Appointment booking systems
  - Lead qualification agents

### 3. Automation Layer (Aria's Role)
- Thread agents doing lead generation while Jason works/sleeps
- Finding companies posting about needing voice solutions
- Drafting outreach messages
- Qualifying opportunities

### 4. The Formula
**Your skills as the product + Automation as the scale + Aria coordinating it**

## Next Steps
- Set up thread agents for lead gen
- Define target industries/use cases
- Create outreach templates
- Build portfolio pieces to demonstrate capability
