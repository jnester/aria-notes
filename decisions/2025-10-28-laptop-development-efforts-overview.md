# Laptop Development Efforts Overview

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Context:** Jason's parallel development efforts on laptop for next-generation agent orchestration

## Current Efforts

### 1. Agent Orchestrator V2 (Primary Focus)

**Location:** `/home/jnester/repos/agent-orchestrator-v2`
**Status:** Recently stabilized, actively developing
**Priority:** HIGHEST - This has Jason's full attention

**Overview:**
- Good balance of simplicity and reliability
- Headless-first architecture (no UI concept yet)
- Has API layer implemented, close to UI integration ready
- Focus on reliability and engine soundness

**Recent Issues & Fixes:**
- Spent 24 hours debugging phantom bugs
- Root cause: CLI API proxy was down (was using dev-2's proxy)
- **Solution:** Switched to production proxy exposed over network
- Added systemd auto-restart for proxy reliability

**Next Steps:**
- Narrow focus on reliability issues
- Solidify engine architecture
- Consider UI integration options

**Details:** See `initial-development-artifacts` directory in project

### 2. AI Orchestrator Dev-2 / Spine (Over-Engineered)

**Location:** `/home/jnester/repos/ai-orchestrator-dev-2`
**Main Code:** `/home/jnester/repos/ai-orchestrator-dev-2/spine/`
**Status:** HOSED as of Oct 27 - NO PROGRESS BEING MADE
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Interesting but currently blocked

**Overview:**
- Created from 16-hour architecture session with ChatGPT-5
- Comprehensive build sheet guiding implementation
- Managed by program director thread
- Build sheet: `/home/jnester/repos/ai-orchestrator-dev-2/spine/BUILD_SHEET.md`
- Work orders system for feature rollout

**Known Issues:**
- Uses CLI Proxy API on port 8280
- **CRITICAL:** CLI Proxy is DOWN
- Environment is broken, needs recovery
- Blocks UI V2 work as well (shared environment)

**Dependencies:**
- CLI Proxy API (port 8280) - NEEDS RESTART

### 3. UI V2

**Location:** `/home/jnester/repos/ai-orchestrator-dev-2/ui-v2`
**Managed By:** thread_016 in ai-orchestrator-dev-2
**Status:** DOWN - Went offline while fixing voice mode
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Promising but currently broken

**Overview:**
- Architecture similar to spine but more directly based on production UI (thread_058)
- Was working well - could chat with thread agents interactively
- Jason likes this UI and its architecture
- Provides more direct control

**Recent History:**
- Working well at one point
- Broke while implementing/fixing voice mode
- Unable to recover since then
- Shares broken environment with spine/dev-2

**Potential Future:**
- Could be combined with Agent Orchestrator V2 engine
- Would provide: good UI + stable engine
- Contingent on getting environment back online

---

## Strategic Considerations

### Option 1: UI V2 + Agent Orchestrator V2
Combine the UI architecture Jason likes with the stable engine. Could be "Nirvana solution."

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Good UI control
- Stable engine
- Clean separation

**Cons:**
- Requires both projects working
- Integration work needed

### Option 2: Roll Forward with Production
Continue with current production system, selectively import features from other efforts.

**Pros:**
- Production is working NOW
- Lower risk
- Incremental improvement

**Cons:**
- Might perpetuate technical debt
- Slower evolution

### Option 3: Continue Parallel Development
Keep all three efforts going, learn from each.

**Pros:**
- Maximum learning
- Compare approaches

**Cons:**
- Resource intensive
- Coordination overhead
- Environment instability issues

## Multi-Agent System Reliability Problem

**Core Challenge:** When working with multi-agent systems, breakage is inevitable. The more agents and complexity, the more failure modes emerge.

### Needed: Automated Recovery System

**When something breaks:**

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify what dependencies are down
   - Check logs for errors
   - Review recent code changes
   - Identify contributing factors

2. **Quick Recovery Attempt**
   - Try immediate fixes
   - Restart failed services
   - If unfixable quickly â†’ proceed to rollback

3. **Instantaneous Rollback**
   - Roll back to last known stable point
   - Use git/snapshots for code state
   - Restore service configurations
   - **Must be fast** - minutes not hours

4. **Sanity Testing**
   - Verify rollback environment is actually stable
   - Run basic health checks
   - Confirm core functionality works

5. **Feature Quarantine**
   - Mark features being worked on as "dangerous"
   - Launch separate investigation thread
   - Continue forward with other safer features
   - Isolate the problem

6. **Investigation & Safe Reintroduction**
   - Separate thread investigates broken features
   - Identifies exact cause of breakage
   - Develops fix or alternative approach
   - Once fixed, port other successful features over
   - Reintroduce fixed dangerous features carefully

**Benefits:**
- Minimize downtime
- Maintain forward progress
- Systematic failure recovery
- Learn from failures without being blocked

## Laptop Access for Remote Monitoring

### SSH Access
- **Laptop IP:** 10.0.0.25 (home network) or 172.19.218.169 (alternative)
- **SSH Port:** 2222 (non-standard)
- **Key:** ~/.ssh/id_dev_aria
- **User:** jnester

### Connection Command
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_dev_aria -p 2222 jnester@10.0.0.25
```

### Goal Owner Responsibilities
1. Monitor status of assigned effort
2. Check logs when issues occur
3. Attempt recovery when possible
4. Report status and issues back to production
5. Nudge development forward on request
6. **DO NOT** modify code Jason is actively editing
7. Work can include: running tests, checking status, restarting services, investigating errors

---

## Next Actions

1. **Create goal owner threads** (2-3 threads):
   - One for Agent Orchestrator V2 monitoring
   - One for Dev-2/Spine + UI V2 recovery
   - Possibly third for production feature porting

2. **Set up SSH access** for threads

3. **Define clear boundaries** on what threads can modify

4. **Enable status reporting** back to production Aria

5. **Start monitoring** and be ready to nudge on request

**Notes taken by:** Aria (production orchestrator)
**Purpose:** Context preservation for remote development monitoring and assistance
