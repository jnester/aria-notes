## 1. Melio API Capabilities

### 1.1 API Overview
Melio provides a Platform API that enables partners to manage:
- Accounts
- Payments
- Vendors
- Merchants
- Checkouts and Charges
- Funding Sources

**Authentication:** Secret API key provided to approved partners

### 1.2 Partner Program Structure
Melio operates a **partnership model** rather than open API access:

**Partner Types:**
1. **Accounting Firm Partners** - No approval needed, Bronze tier auto-activates
2. **Technology/Integration Partners** - Requires formal partnership application
3. **Platform Embedded Partners** - For SaaS, B2B marketplaces, financial institutions

**Notable Partners:** Shopify, Capital One, Gusto, Fiserv

### 1.3 API Access Requirements

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Melio's API is **NOT publicly available**. Key restrictions:

- ‚ùå No public developer portal with open signup
- ‚ùå No sandbox environment for independent developers
- ‚úÖ Requires formal partnership agreement with Melio
- ‚úÖ Partners authenticate via secret API keys
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Terms of Service explicitly prohibit reverse engineering or unofficial API access

**Implication:** Any integration would require either:
1. Becoming an official Melio API partner, OR
2. Partnering with an existing Melio integration partner (like Silent Infotech)

### 1.4 Integration Capabilities
Once API access is secured, Melio supports:
- Real-time payment status synchronization
- Vendor data management
- Bill/invoice creation and tracking
- Multiple payment methods (ACH, checks, virtual cards, wire transfers)
- OCR-based bill capture
- Email invoice scanning
- Transaction webhooks for status updates

---

## 2. Odoo API and Integration Capabilities

### 2.1 External API Overview
Odoo provides robust External API capabilities via **XML-RPC**:

**Available Operations:**
- List, count, read records
- Create, update, delete operations
- Search and combined search-read operations
- Field introspection
- Model inspection

**Authentication:** User credentials + API keys

### 2.2 API Access Requirements

**IMPORTANT PRICING NOTE:**
Access to Odoo's External API is **ONLY available on Custom pricing plans**, NOT on:
- ‚ùå One App Free plan
- ‚ùå Standard plan
- ‚úÖ Custom plan (requires upgrade)

**Current Situation:** If Lumina is on Standard plan, they would need to upgrade to Custom to enable API access.

### 2.3 Invoice and Payment API Operations

Odoo's API supports comprehensive accounts payable operations:

**Creating Invoices:**
```python
invoice_id = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,
    'account.move', 'create',
    [{
        'partner_id': vendor_id,
        'move_type': 'in_invoice',
        'invoice_line_ids': [(0, 0, {...})]
    }])
```

**Registering Payments:**
```python
# Modern method (Odoo 14+)
payment_register_id = models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,
    'account.payment.register', 'create',
    [{
        'journal_id': bank_journal_id,
        'payment_method_id': payment_method_id,
        'invoice_ids': [(4, invoice_id)]
    }])

models.execute_kw(db, uid, password,
    'account.payment.register', 'create_payments',
    [[payment_register_id]])
```

**Payment Reconciliation:**
- Automatic reconciliation via `js_assign_outstanding_line` method
- Links invoice with payment transaction
- Updates invoice status to "Paid"

### 2.4 Integration Methods
Odoo supports multiple integration approaches:
1. **Custom Modules** - Python-based Odoo addons
2. **External Middleware** - Separate service using XML-RPC API
3. **Pre-built Connectors** - Third-party modules from Odoo Apps Store

- ‚ùå **OCR Bill Capture** - Manual entry or third-party addon needed
- ‚ùå **Payment Method Flexibility** - Limited to checks and manual bank transfers
- ‚ùå **Vendor Payment Portal** - Vendors can't receive payments electronically

#### Implementation Requirements:

**To use Odoo-only approach:**
1. **Manual ACH Setup**
   - Enter vendor payment info in Odoo
   - Export payment batch file
   - Upload to bank's ACH portal
   - Manually reconcile in Odoo
   - Labor intensive, error-prone

2. **Check Payments**
   - Purchase check stock
   - Configure check printing layout
   - Print checks from Odoo
   - Mail checks to vendors
   - Wait for clearing, manually reconcile

3. **Bank Integration**

- ‚úÖ **No Integration Needed** - Everything in one system
- ‚úÖ **Complete Control** - All data stays in Odoo
- ‚úÖ **No Vendor Lock-in** - Not dependent on payment service

#### Cons:
- ‚ùå **Manual ACH Process** - Export/import through bank portal
- ‚ùå **Limited Payment Methods** - Mostly checks
- ‚ùå **Higher Labor Cost** - Significantly more manual work
- ‚ùå **Slower Payments** - Check mail time, no instant transfers
- ‚ùå **Steep Learning Curve** - Odoo AP module complex for new users
- ‚ùå **No OCR** - Manual bill entry (time-consuming)

#### Cost Analysis:

**Initial Setup:**
- Odoo AP module configuration: $1,000-3,000 (consultant)
- Training: $1,500-3,000 (staff unfamiliar with Odoo)
- Check stock & printer: $200-500
- **Total Setup: $2,700-6,500**

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Check stock: $20-40/month = $240-480/year
- Postage: $15-30/month = $180-360/year
- Additional labor (estimated): 5-10 hours/month @ $25/hr = $1,500-3,000/year
- **Annual Recurring: $1,920-3,840**

**Hidden Costs:**
- Slower payment = potential lost early-pay discounts
- Manual errors requiring correction time
- Vendor frustration with check payments
- Staff time on reconciliation

#### Training Burden:

**Research Finding:** Odoo has a **significantly steeper learning curve** than QuickBooks or purpose-built tools like Melio.

**Comparison:**
- **QuickBooks:** "Hours to days" to proficiency
- **Melio:** Intuitive, minimal training
- **Odoo AP Module:** "Days to weeks" of dedicated training

**Training Requirements:**
- Initial training: 2-3 days (16-24 hours)
- Ongoing support: 4-8 hours/month for first 6 months
- Workflow documentation: 10-15 hours to create
- **Total Training Investment: 40-80 hours**

**Staff Impact:**
If Mom's company staff are currently comfortable with Melio, forcing Odoo-only would require:
- Unlearning familiar Melio interface
- Learning complex Odoo navigation
- Adapting to different workflows
- Potential resistance and productivity loss

#### Recommendation Context:

**Consider Odoo-only if:**
- Company already has deep Odoo expertise in-house
- Budget is extremely tight (cannot afford any external service)
- Check payments are acceptable to vendors
- Transaction volume is very low (< 10 bills/month)
- Staff willing to invest significant training time

**NOT recommended if:**
- Staff unfamiliar with Odoo
- Modern payment methods desired (ACH, virtual cards, instant)
- Time is more valuable than cost savings
- Vendor relationships matter (they prefer electronic payment)
- Current Melio workflow is efficient

**Realistic Assessment:**
Based on research, this option would likely **increase operational costs** due to:
- Staff time for manual processes (5-10 hrs/month √ó $25/hr = $1,500-3,000/year)
- Training time investment (40-80 hours upfront)
- Slower vendor payments (relationship impact)
- Higher error rates from manual entry

**Melio integration cost ($8,700-25,100 Year 1)** may actually be **cheaper than Odoo-only** when factoring true labor costs.
