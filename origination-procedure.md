# Origination Procedure for AI Creativity

*Developed: January 26, 2026*
*Origin: Conversation between Jason and Aria, building on a naming session Jason had with his dad*

## The Problem

AI tends to produce the weighted average of its training data. When asked to "be original," it samples from the same probability space—producing output that *feels* original but is actually just less-common pattern combinations.

You can't prompt *away* the training distribution.

## The Solution: Forced Origination Through Orthogonal Input

Instead of asking for originality, **engineer it through process**.

### The Procedure

1. **Choose orthogonal source material**
   - Something completely unrelated to the target domain
   - Unique to the person/project for true originality
   - Examples: childhood books, blacksmithing, deep sea creatures, volcanic geology

2. **Extract abstract properties**
   - Don't use the source literally
   - Pull out transferable qualities
   - Examples: Redwall names → syllables → phonetic qualities (strong, soft, sharp)
   - Examples: Deep sea creatures → sleek, reflective, sharp, bioluminescent

3. **Discard source, keep properties**
   - The source is just a generator
   - The output should NOT resemble the source
   - Talveon doesn't look or sound like "Redwall"

4. **Apply properties through target heuristics**
   - What makes a good [name/logo/song/product]?
   - Filter combinations through domain-specific quality criteria
   - Iterate and permute

5. **Human resonance check**
   - AI generates candidates
   - Human selects based on *feeling*
   - "How does it feel when I say it out loud?"

## Why This Works

- **Injects entropy** from outside the expected domain
- **Breaks training bias** by forcing unexpected connections
- **Mirrors natural human creativity** (juxtaposition, metaphor, unexpected connections)
- **Structured enough** that output isn't just noise

## Key Insight: Abstraction Before Combination

The magic is in the abstraction layer. You're not combining things literally—you're:
1. Extracting *properties* from source material
2. Those properties are abstract enough to translate across domains
3. Applying them to a completely different medium

## Application: Company Name Generator Agent

Potential product using this procedure:

1. **Interview user** for unique source material (favorite books, movies, interests)
2. **Extract syllables/properties** from that material
3. **Combine through heuristics** (strong opening, vowel flow, forward-moving ending)
4. **Filter out**: pharma-sounding names, already-taken names
5. **Validate availability**: domain search, copyright search, Google search
6. **Present qualified candidates** for human selection

### Validation Searches Needed
- Domain availability (registrar API)
- Copyright/trademark database
- General Google search for conflicts

## Broader Applications

This procedure applies to any creative output where originality matters:
- Logo design
- Product naming
- Music composition
- Business ideas
- Art direction
- Writing/storytelling

## The Human-AI Split

| AI Does | Human Does |
|---------|------------|
| Choose orthogonal sources | Final resonance check |
| Extract abstract properties | "How does it feel?" |
| Combinatorics at scale | Emotional validation |
| Apply target heuristics | Stakes/meaning |
| Filter bad candidates | |
| Validate availability | |

## Origin Story

Jason spent a month failing to name his company using AI tools. His dad said: "What's something unique to you?" They pulled from Redwall (childhood books), extracted syllables, combined them, and iterated until they found **Talveon** (T-A-L-V-E-O-N).

The procedure:
- Val + Trio → Valtrio (good but not quite right)
- Swap V and T → Talvrio
- Remove R → Talvio
- Add -eon suffix → Talveon
- Check: I changed to E for availability

Jason bought talveon.com for $1,000.
