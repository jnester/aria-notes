## Key Intel Gathered

### AI Tool Landscape
- Many professionals still on Copilot, not Claude (corporate security policies favor Microsoft - companies haven't vetted Anthropic's data security)
- Some on Claude Code - one technical co-founder said it's "essential" 
- Quote: "Back in the day, good programmer = 40 lines/day, great = 120 lines/day. With Claude Code = 5,000 lines/day"
- Nobody at event knew about Claude.ai - Jason in different info stream than most

### Market Conditions
- Big established companies: hiring freezes, slow security policies
- Startups with VC funding: actively hiring, need to move fast
- Advice: Target companies you've worked with before - that's where first contracts come from

### Legal/Contracts
- Some law firms have "no draft" policy for AI - research only
- Founder lawyer's secret: Use consulting to fund products, keep core process in contracts

### Supply Chain
- Manhattan Associates contracts ~$1M over 5 years
- Customization work for base software = opportunity for AI acceleration
- NanoClaw repo noted - Claude-based customization pattern

## Observations

- Event was extremely diverse, good mix of people
- Everyone primed to talk - low stakes environment
- The protocol worked: sign-up desk → drink → find someone alone → conversation spawns naturally
- Jason was believed as "AI developer" without question - credibility established
- Biggest mistake: didn't talk to event coordinators, only attendees
- Realization: LinkedIn is just one big networking room, same low stakes as in-person

- This muscle transfers to other contexts (Canton Street, LinkedIn outreach)
- Intel gathering is valuable - understanding how money moves, who uses what tools
