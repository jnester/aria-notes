# Business Ideas from Family Visit - December 26, 2025

## Context
Jason visiting family in Rabun Gap, Georgia for Christmas. Family members shared domain knowledge leading to three concrete AI/automation business opportunities.

## Idea 1: First Responder Building Layout System
**Source:** Alan (mom's boyfriend, firefighter)

**Problem:**
- First responders can't determine interior building structure from outside
- Need to know: crawl spaces, number of units, hidden apartments on backside
- Police/firefighters doing walkarounds can't always assess interior layout

**Solution:** Floor plan dataset accessible to dispatchers and first responders via their systems/phones

**Connection:** Alan has contacts at Gwinnett County fire department and city officials. Gwinnett has many apartment buildings—big problem there.

**Challenges:** Government sales cycles are slow; data acquisition (where do floor plans come from?) is a big unknown.

## Idea 2: Production Management / Supply Chain Automation (Lumina)
**Source:** Mom's company (she co-founded it, now part-time)

**Problem:**
- Manual process for parts ordering, factory quantities, reacting to order changes/cancellations
- Constant friction from manual spreadsheet operations
- Previous automation attempt failed

**Current State:**
- Denise currently manages via spreadsheet
- Mom managed it the same way for years (has old spreadsheets)

**Denise's Biggest Pain Point:** Customers changing POs after submission—
- Configuration changes (e.g., "we want 24-packs instead of 12-packs")  
- Date changes ("we need this run earlier/later")
- Cascades into inventory issues, supplier coordination, scheduling other runs

**Solution:** System that ingests all data—orders, lead times, supplier inventory—and calculates optimal decisions faster, especially handling changes/exceptions.

**Side Opportunity:** Suppliers manually update spreadsheets for each customer showing inventory—could automate that upstream piece too.

**Key Contact:** Stephen (Chief Revenue Officer, son of other co-founder). Technically savvy, likes AI, already trying to use it but it's taking him a long time.

**Approach:**
1. Get mom's old spreadsheets for domain knowledge
2. Learn why previous automation failed
3. First call with Stephen (decision maker)
4. If green-lit, talk to Denise about pain points
5. Position as "helping Denise" not "replacing Denise"

**Why This First:** Direct access, bounded problem, fastest path to revenue, generalizable to other manufacturing/distribution companies.

## Idea 3: AI Director of Operations (Healthcare Practices)
**Source:** Mom's domain expertise—former Director of Operations & Patient Services

**Insight:** Most of that work can be done remotely

**Problem:** Startups/small practices can't afford a real Director of Ops, so they struggle without one

**Solution:** AI agent trained on her domain knowledge to handle operations + lead follow-up

**Model:** 
- Mom could supervise/approve decisions
- Train it over time with human-in-the-loop
- Eventually scale to managing multiple companies simultaneously

## Recommended Priority

**Start with Lumina (Idea 2):**
- Direct access through family
- Concrete, bounded problem
- Clear pain point identified (PO changes)
- Fastest path to revenue
- What you build could apply to other companies

## Next Steps
- [ ] Get mom's old spreadsheets
- [ ] Find out why previous automation attempt failed
- [ ] Schedule intro call with Stephen
