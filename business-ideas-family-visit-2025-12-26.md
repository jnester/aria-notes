# Business Ideas from Family Visit - December 26, 2025

## Overview
Three domain-specific AI/automation project ideas from family with real domain expertise.

## Idea 1: First Responder Building Layout System
**Source:** Alan (Mom's boyfriend, firefighter)

**Problem:**
- First responders can't determine interior structure from outside
- Need to know: crawl spaces, number of units, hidden apartments on backside
- Walking around building doesn't reveal internal layout

**Solution:**
- Floor plan dataset accessible to dispatchers
- Delivery to first responders via phones/computer systems

**Connections:**
- Alan has connections to Gwinnett County Fire Department
- Gwinnett has many apartment buildings—big problem for them

**Status:** Promising but government sales cycles are slow, data acquisition is a big unknown

## Idea 2: Production Management / Supply Chain Automation (Lumina) ⭐ PRIORITY
**Source:** Mom (co-founder of Lumina, former operations manager)

**Company:** Lumina - sells fireplaces

**Problem:**
- Manual process for parts ordering, factory quantities, reacting to order changes
- Constant friction from manual operations
- Previous automation attempt failed
- Currently managed via spreadsheet by Denise

**Denise's Biggest Pain Point:**
Customers changing POs after submission:
- Configuration changes (e.g., "24-packs instead of 12-packs")
- Date changes ("need this run earlier/later")
- Cascades into inventory issues, supplier coordination, run scheduling

**Solution:**
- System that ingests all data—orders, lead times, supplier inventory
- Calculates optimal decisions faster
- Handles exception/change management (where AI shines)

**Side Opportunity:**
- Suppliers manually update spreadsheets for each customer showing inventory
- Could automate that upstream piece too

**Key People:**
- **Stephen** - Chief Revenue Officer, son of other co-founder (Mom's former husband), makes decisions, technically savvy, likes AI, trying to use it but it's taking him a long time
- **Denise** - Currently manages production via spreadsheet

**Resources Available:**
- Mom's old spreadsheets (simpler version of current process)
- Mom's domain knowledge

**Why This First:**
- Direct access via mom
- Bounded, concrete problem
- Fastest path to revenue
- Supply chain automation is generalizable

**Approach:**
- Position as helping Denise, not replacing her
- "What's your biggest pain point?" framing
- Find out why previous automation failed
- Start with biggest pain point, expand over time

**Next Steps:**
1. Get mom's old spreadsheets for domain learning
2. Learn what went wrong with previous automation attempt
3. Intro call with Stephen (decision maker)
4. If green-lit, discovery call with Denise

## Idea 3: AI Director of Operations (Healthcare Practices)
**Source:** Mom's domain expertise—Director of Operations & Patient Services

**Insight:** Most of that work can be done remotely

**Problem:**
- Startups/small practices can't afford a real Director of Ops
- They struggle without one

**Solution:**
- AI agent trained on Mom's domain knowledge
- Handles operations + lead follow-up
- Human-in-the-loop approval system as it learns

**Model:**
- Mom could supervise/approve decisions
- Train it over time
- Eventually scale to managing multiple companies simultaneously

**Status:** Interesting long-term, but broader and fuzzier—harder to scope first version

## Summary
| Idea | Priority | Readiness | Timeline |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Lumina Supply Chain | ⭐ HIGH | Ready now | Weeks |
| First Responder | Medium | Needs research | Months |
| AI Director of Ops | Lower | Needs scoping | Long-term |

**Recommendation:** Start with Lumina. Direct access, concrete problem, fastest to revenue, generalizable.
