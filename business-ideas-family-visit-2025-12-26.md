# Business Ideas - Family Visit (December 26, 2025)

Notes from conversations with family at mom's house in Rabun Gap, Georgia.

## Idea 1: First Responder Building Layout System

**Source:** Alan (mom's boyfriend, firefighter)

**Problem:** First responders and police can't determine interior structure of buildings from outside:
- Crawl spaces
- Number of apartments/units
- Hidden units on backside of buildings
- Interior layout not visible from exterior walkthrough

**Solution:** Floor plan dataset accessible to dispatchers and first responders via their systems/phones

**Connection:** Gwinnett County fire department and city contacts available through family. Gwinnett has lots of apartment buildings—big problem for them.

**Notes:** Government sales cycles are long. Data acquisition (where do floor plans come from?) is a big unknown. Cool and impactful but not the fastest path.

## Idea 2: Production Management / Supply Chain Automation (Lumina) ⭐ PRIORITY

**Source:** Mom (co-founder of Lumina, fireplace company)

**Problem:** Manual process for managing production—parts ordering, factory quantities, reacting to order changes/cancellations. Constant friction from manual operations.

**Current State:**
- Mom used to manage it all in a spreadsheet for years
- Now another woman (Denise) manages it via spreadsheet
- They tried automated system before—it failed
- Process is more complicated now

**Denise's Biggest Pain Point:** Customers changing POs after submission:
- Configuration changes (e.g., "58 12-packs" → "24 12-packs + rest in 6-packs")
- Date changes ("need this run earlier/later")
- Cascades into inventory issues, supplier coordination, run scheduling

**Solution:** System that ingests all data—orders, lead times, supplier inventory—and calculates optimal decisions faster. Handles exception/change management.

**Side Opportunity:** Suppliers manually update spreadsheets for each customer showing inventory—could automate that upstream piece too.

**Key Contact:** Stephen (Chief Revenue Officer, son of other co-founder, mom's former husband). Technically savvy, likes AI, trying to use it but it's taking him a long time. He makes decisions.

**Why This One First:**
- Direct access through mom
- Bounded, concrete problem (orders in, parts out, react to changes)
- Fastest path to revenue—could scope pilot within weeks
- Generalizable to other manufacturing/distribution companies
- Classic "exception handling" problem where AI shines

**Approach:**
1. Get mom's old spreadsheets to understand domain/data structure
2. Learn why previous automation attempt failed
3. First call with Stephen (decision maker)
4. If green-lit, talk to Denise about pain points
5. Position as "helping Denise" not "replacing Denise"—she becomes the hero who brought in a tool

**Assets Available:**
- Mom's old spreadsheets (she offered to provide)
- Mom's domain knowledge
- Direct intro to Stephen

## Idea 3: AI Director of Operations (Healthcare Practices)

**Source:** Mom's domain expertise—former Director of Operations & Director of Patient Services

**Insight:** Most of that work can be done remotely (though she did it in person)

**Problem:** Startups/small healthcare practices can't afford a real Director of Ops, so they struggle without one

**Solution:** AI agent trained on her domain knowledge to handle:
- General operations management
- Lead follow-up (not just generation)
- Patient services coordination

**Model:**
- Mom could supervise/approve decisions
- Train it over time with human-in-the-loop
- Eventually scale to managing multiple companies simultaneously
- She keeps training it, it gets smarter, she can serve more clients

**Notes:** Broader and fuzzier than Lumina. Harder to scope first version. Good long-term play.

## Recommended Priority Order

1. **Lumina (Supply Chain)** — Start here. Concrete, accessible, fastest to revenue.
2. **AI Director of Ops** — Long-term, after proving the model works.
3. **First Responder System** — Park for now unless a clear opportunity emerges.
