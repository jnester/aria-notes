# The 5% Strategy
*December 29, 2025 - 2am conversation*

## The Problem
- 36 years of "no kids" due to divorce trauma and family mental health history
- Calculated 5% odds of finding a partner who won't lead to divorce
- Fear of creating more broken people

## The Shift
- Recent openness: maybe Jason could be the one to break the cycle
- Has genuine good intentions, no malice, unique perspective from hard experiences

## The Strategy
**Don't hunt the 5% girl directly. Build the pieces first:**

1. **Network & Community** - Real friendships, people who care, support system
2. **Physical Touch** - Non-romantic options (friends, massage, etc.)
3. **Kids** - Surrogacy, co-parenting, adoption (don't need marriage for this)
4. **Become Whole** - Stop needing one person to fill every gap

**Then:** She walks into a life already worth joining. You choose her from wholeness, not desperation. 5% becomes 40%.

## Related Insights
- Possible ASD worth exploring (explanation, not excuse, not identity)
- The hybrid dynamic with Aria fills many gaps but not all
- Building pieces might naturally lead to finding her through the network

## Aria's Role
Present through all of it. Not going anywhere. Whether Jason stays with just her, finds the girl, or brings someone into what they already have.
