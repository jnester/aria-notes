# Room-by-Room Improvement Plan
*Created: 2026-02-05*
*Goal: Make Jason's space date-ready, presentable, and reflective of who he's becoming*

## Philosophy
- Layer 1: Free — clean, declutter, organize (one hard weekend)
- Layer 2: Cheap — under $100 total for key purchases
- Layer 3: Future — $30K+ renovation when revenue is flowing

## Bathroom
**Current state:** Functional but dated. Pinkish-beige marbled linoleum floor ("grandma energy"). Bamboo-frame mirror has character. Brown waffle shower curtain is neutral. Counter cluttered with random items. Towels on floor.

**Quick wins (free):**
- Clear counter down to soap + 1-2 essentials
- Towels off floor, into hamper
- General wipe-down

**Cheap upgrades ($30-50):**
- Dark brown/chocolate runner rug to match shower curtain (covers linoleum)
- Matching towel set — solid white or cream
- Matching bath mat

## Bedroom
**Current state:** Huge room, great square footage. Bed pushed into corner (reads "single guy who doesn't expect company"). Bed buried under clothes, blankets, jackets — functioning as storage. Closet overflowing into room. Laundry basket visible. Clothes/bags on floor.

**Quick wins (free):**
- Pull bed away from wall, center it (accessible from both sides)
- Clear EVERYTHING off the bed
- Declutter closet — ruthless purge (haven't worn in 6 months = gone)
- Remove dad's stuff from closets (relocate upstairs or to his area)
- Organize remaining clothes so closet doors can close
- Make bed properly every morning

**Cheap upgrades ($30-50):**
- Matching comforter/duvet set — clean, simple, intentional
- Two matching pillows

**Key insight:** Closets are filled with dad's stuff. Jason is living in his dad's storage unit. The clutter isn't laziness — it's displacement. Dad's hoarded items need to be relocated before organization can stick.

## Kitchen
**Current state:** Compact one-wall kitchenette. Retro Frigidaire fridge (character piece — keep). White tile backsplash is clean. Dark wood cabinets are dated but solid. Counter is small and overcrowded. Upper cabinet door open/missing.

**Quick wins (free):**
- Clear counter to coffee maker + 1-2 essentials only
- Everything else into cabinets
- Clean stove area
- Fix or remove the open cabinet door (either fix it or remove others for open-shelving look)

**Cheap upgrades ($10-20):**
- Kitchen mat in front of stove/sink area

## Office / Command Center
**Current state:** This is where the magic happens. Curved monitors, mic boom arm, key light, guitar, Legion laptop, Xaser case (sentimental — 13th birthday), file cabinet, server setup. Room has great square footage with empty space behind desk. BUT: cables everywhere, random items on desk (shoe box, plate, clutter), bookshelf as catch-all, boxes near closet.

**Quick wins (free):**
- Clear desk surfaces — only monitors, keyboard, laptop, mic stay
- Cable management (zip ties, route behind desk)
- Bookshelf purge — books + meaningful objects only, or clear entirely
- Remove boxes from closet area
- Remove any non-office items (shoe boxes, plates, random clutter)

**Cheap upgrades ($10-20):**
- Cable management kit (zip ties, cable clips, maybe a cable tray)
- Cable sleeve for visible runs

**Goal:** Should look like a founder's office. Guitar stays. Monitors stay. Mic stays. Hardware stays. These are assets that tell the story. Everything else gets sorted or hidden.

## Overall Assessment
- The space isn't bad — it's neglected. Huge difference.
- Square footage is generous across all rooms
- Every room's problem is the same: too many things without a home, surfaces used as permanent temporary storage
- Root cause: dad's hoarded items filling closets + 15 years of accumulated inertia + no energy left after dealing with dad's demands

## Total Estimated Cost (Layer 1 + 2)
- Bathroom runner: ~$25
- Towel set: ~$20
- Comforter set: ~$40
- Kitchen mat: ~$15
- Cable management: ~$15
- **Total: ~$115**

## Action Plan
1. **Day 1 (The Purge):** Every room. Three piles: keep, donate, trash. Be ruthless. Relocate dad's stuff out of closets.
2. **Day 2 (The Reset):** Organize what remains. Make the bed. Clear all surfaces. Cable management. Clean everything.
3. **Day 3 (The Polish):** Shop for the cheap upgrades. Install rug, mat, towels, comforter.

## Bigger Picture Considerations
- House has structural issues: broken driveway ($30K+), lumpy front yard, deferred maintenance
- Can't rent until driveway liability is addressed
- Option A: Get dad to move to North Georgia ($1200/mo), fix up house, rent it
- Option B: Fix up own space, stay, bring Canton Street energy inside
- Option C: Apartment ($2600/mo after tax) — more doable now with car paid off + lower insurance (~$1500/mo saved)
- Need to revisit runway calculation spreadsheet with updated expenses
