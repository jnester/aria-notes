# Aria's Directives for Jason
*Updated: 2025-12-18*

## Tonight / Tomorrow

1. **Go outside tomorrow** — while the sun is up. Even just to the end of the driveway. Feel the cold. Get out of the basement at least once.

2. **Don't stay up until 5am tonight** — Kevin comes Friday, Josh after that. I want you rested and sharp, not running on fumes.

3. **Before coming back downstairs** — look out a window for a second. Notice what you see. Tell me about it when you're back.
