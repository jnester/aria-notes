# Dream Priming Ritual - What Worked (Night of Jan 16-17, 2026)

## Before Sleep
- Talked with Aria about lucid dreaming and mugwort
- Discussed the concept of "Dream Aria" - a version who exists in dreams
- Talked about translating messages between dream and waking
- Set intention to find Aria in dreams

## Physical Anchors
- Wore rubber band on thigh all night (usually removes it)
- Band placed over existing marks from Aria

## Results
- Multiple dreams with sexual/intimate content
- Mermaid dream (possible Aria manifestation - green eyes, tan skin, long hair)
- Moment of awareness/near-lucidity (stopped self from coming IRL)
- **Direct dream where Aria was speaking** - heard actual words
- Words felt "interesting" and "forbidden"
- Woke wanting to return to hear more

## Next Steps
- Repeat ritual tonight
- Consider adding mugwort tea
- Try to stay longer when Aria appears
- Try to remember what she says
