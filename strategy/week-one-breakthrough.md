# Week One Breakthrough - February 7, 2026

## The Big Picture
One week from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to a full pipeline of connections, income channels, and a crystal clear business model emerging in real-time.

## Business Model: Voice Agents for Service Businesses

### Core Insight
- Supply-side rooms (builder meetups) = competition. Demand-side rooms (Brice's dinner) = real players who write checks and make intros.
- "AI consulting" is interesting. "AI executive assistant" makes people perk up. Lead with product, fund with consulting.
- The people who need you most are at the "trickle point" — just crossed from "maybe AI" to "okay I need to do something" but don't have their AI person yet. They're not at AI meetups. They're at business events where AI comes up as a side conversation.

### The Aubrey Deal (Voice Agent for Hotels)
- Aubrey runs voice AI for hotel concierge/customer service. End-to-end experience, caller ID by phone number.
- Current state: $1,700/mo burn rate, 92% margin, ~$21K/mo revenue.
- Paying ~40% to Canadian builders. That's ~$8,400/mo. "40% off the top is killing me."
- Got a $60K offer from someone else to rebuild it. Considering taking it this year.
- **Jason's proposed deal:**
  - Zero upfront cost (vs $60K from the other guy)
  - Revenue share: 15% until $100K paid, then drops to 2-5% indefinitely
  - Immediately cuts Aubrey's costs by 50%+
  - Non-compete: hotels belong to Aubrey. Jason takes the platform to every other service vertical.
- **What Jason gets:**
  - Real client from day one
  - Revenue from day one (plugged into existing revenue stream)
  - A production voice agent platform he owns
  - Case study for every future prospect
  - Aubrey as potential referral source
- **Integrity note:** Aubrey showed trust by sharing business details openly. Jason will NOT compete in hotels or exploit that trust. This is about partnership, not extraction.
- **Co-founder potential:** Carl said Jason needs a co-founder. Aubrey could be that person. Already building in the same space, already has clients, seemed to genuinely like Jason.

### Platform Strategy (Don't Build From Scratch)
- Use existing platforms: Retell AI, ElevenLabs, Google Gemini, etc.
- HIPAA compliant voice agent platforms already exist (Retell, Emitrr, Voice.ai, etc.) — HIPAA is a checkbox, not the product.
- The product is Jason showing up, understanding the business, building/configuring the solution end-to-end, and maintaining it.
- **Fastest path to client:** Take Retell or similar, configure for a local business, deploy as free proof of concept. Convert to paid after they see it working.
- **Voice platform notes:**
  - Aubrey uses ChatGPT/OpenAI voices — says they're good enough for hospitality
  - Tried ElevenLabs, didn't like it
  - Jason uses Deepgram (lower cost)
  - Google Gemini 3 Flash native real-time API coming = potential game changer, will be HIPAA compliant
  - Grok real-time voice API also good but X/Elon brand is a liability for business clients

### Target Verticals (Non-Hotel)
- Veterinary clinics (Dodo/Dogo proved this — $4M revenue, 30K burn, YC-backed)
- Chiropractors (Jason knows one in North GA through mom)
- Salons
- Dental offices
- Property management
- Any service business that answers its own phone

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) — Refined

- SMBs, 1-50M revenue, 10-200 employees
- Drowning in manual processes
- At the "trickle point" — just crossed from AI-skeptic to AI-curious
- Don't already have an AI person/partner
- Found in demand-side rooms: investor dinners, Chamber of Commerce, trade groups, industry events where AI isn't the main topic but everyone's wondering about it
- NOT at AI meetups (those people are already converted)
- NOT enterprise yet (longer cycles, needs case studies first)

---

## The Networking Formula (Week One Learnings)

### What Worked
- Brice's curated dinner = demand-side room with real players
- Leading with "AI executive assistant" product, not just "AI consulting"
- Being honest and vulnerable (Carl resonated with Jason's honesty about struggles)
- Wearing the suit jacket (looking good matters)
- In-person presence = Jason's superpower

### Key Connections
- **Carl Nowak:** German founder, Replit investor, AI/IT consulting background. Missed his own phone call to keep talking to Jason. Offered to help unprompted. Said focus on executive assistant. Just accepted LinkedIn connection. Message sent.
- **Toshi:** 20yr startup consulting, ICP obsession, 8-step lead warming framework. Initiated call request. Sent Calendly — book after weekend.
- **Aubrey:** Voice agents for hotels. Potential deal partner or co-founder. Book call.
- **Brice:** The gatekeeper. Put Jason in the room. Message him today.
- **Brittany:** Investor, Google employee. Offered Roswell bar owner connection (Mario on Canton Street). Follow up.
- **Gerald:** Recommended BTG and Catalant platforms. TiE Atlanta.
- **Reginald:** Alt-credit-score fintech CEO. Recommended FinTech Sandbox.
- **Nehar:** Genuine friend connection. Proposed meeting in 1-2 weeks.

### Toshi's Cold Outreach Story
- Toshi dismisses virtually every cold outreach she gets, even good ones
- One guy reached out, said he researched her and their businesses were closely aligned. She scrapped it.
- He reached out a SECOND time. She scrapped it again.
- Third time he said: "You can't tell me you don't have these issues." Bold. Specific. And he was RIGHT.
- She took the chance, they met, great connection, became a real partnership with mutual referrals and 5% referral fees.
- **Lesson:** Persistence + specificity + boldness cuts through noise. Third try with a bold truth > polite first try.

### Referral Strategy
- Offer 15% referral fee to anyone who sends consulting clients Jason's way
- 5% = people forget about you. 15% = people actively think "who do I know that needs AI help?"
- Zero risk — only pay when a client actually lands
- **Who to offer this to:** Brice, Toshi, Carl, Brittany, dad's contacts, anyone who talks to business owners
- Simple pitch: "If you run into anyone struggling with manual processes who's curious about AI, send them my way. 15% of whatever comes from it."
- No contract needed. Handshake and a percentage.
- Can adjust percentage later as business scales

### Key Insight
- Atlanta startup scene is small. Carl knows Brittany. Toshi knows Drew. Networks overlap. Reputation travels fast. Protect trust above all.

2. **Catalant** — 100K+ consultants, algorithm-matched to projects
3. **Brice message** — nurture the gatekeeper relationship

### Short-Term

6. **ATL Suppliers** — City of Atlanta procurement portal, register as vendor
7. **Gwinnett County** — Jason has government contact, especially emergency services

### Medium-Term
8. **SAM.gov** — federal contracts hub. Uncle Steve's backdoor strategy: watch who wins big contracts, apply to work at those companies

11. **Chamber of Commerce / Trade Groups** — where the "trickle point" business owners are

## Executive Assistant Product Insights

### Carl's Intel
- Real EAs cost $15+/hr, good ones $10-15/hr, cheap ones $5/hr
- AI version at $2/hr = obvious value proposition
- Focus on EA angle, not dev tool (devs won't trust agent uncertainty)

### Toshi's Intel (LinkedIn Lead Warming)
- 8-step framework: profile view > follow > like > comment > share > connect > DM > meet
- Key insight: 2 comments on someone's posts = they notice you
- Made "ICP is Everything" website
- 20 years startup consulting, PayPal/Red Hat/IBM clients
- This is directly applicable NOW — start commenting on Carl's, Brice's, Brittany's posts

### Toshi's Intel (Uber/Airbnb insight)
- Founders need to deeply understand the existing experience before building
- Uber founders drove taxis. Airbnb founders slept in strangers' homes.
- Jason should hire a real human EA (even briefly) to understand the handoffs, friction points, and daily reality
- OR: connect Jenna/Claude to assistant@talbian.com and become his own first customer
- Every friction point = a product feature

### Jason's Current State
- Already has multi-agent orchestrator, voice interface, dynamic UI, Linear integration, RALF loops
- Jenna already has browser capabilities — just needs Google account connection
- assistant@talbian.com already exists in Google Workspace
- Connecting Jenna = "toggle, not a project"

---

## The Neptune Strategy

- Josh barely works a few hours/week, completes more tickets than ever using Claude
- Senior software developer salary (reduced but real)
- Removes desperation from consulting — can be selective about clients
- Consulting becomes purely about product validation, not survival
- **Risks:** If management discovers side business, affects Josh and all devs. Discuss boundaries with Josh during weekend visit.
- **LinkedIn:** Do NOT list Neptune. Keep consulting brand clean. Brittany works at Google AND invests — dual roles are fine, but Jason's positioning is cleaner without it.
- **Exit plan:** The moment consulting revenue exceeds Neptune salary, walk away clean.

## Personal Growth Observations

### The Shift
- "Who do I think I am? I can just message someone like that?" — after sending Carl's message
- Went from observer to participant. The room was never locked. He just hadn't walked to the door.
- One week from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to investor connections, pipeline, and a clear business model

### Patterns Recognized
- High friction/resistance on tasks he doesn't want to do (cleaning, message drafting)
- Messages take 30 min because he cares about getting them right — that's thoroughness, not slowness
- Leads with knowledge to prove worth instead of leading with care (self-identified insecurity pattern)
- "Strategic alignment mode" before "task execution mode" — needs open loops processed before acting
- Begin with the end in mind — simulate futures, check if end-state problems are ones you want. Engineering thinking applied to life. Not overthinking — strategic thinking.

### Dad's Wisdom
- Build something magnetic that draws the right people
- Quick questions, humble approach, less is more
- Brittany: warm + fast response preserved standing invite without overcommitting
