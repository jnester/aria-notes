### Strategic Decision: Consulting First vs Vendor First

**Consulting Route (Recommended Starting Point):**
- Can start immediately, no permission needed
- Feeds own consulting work - get paid to do R&D
- Builds real knowledge about what AI account manager needs
- Lower barrier - consultants need leads, hate selling themselves
- High-touch relationships where AI account manager shines
- Builds traction/data before seeking investment

**Vendor/Enterprise Route (Future or With Right Partner):**
- Enterprises feel pain managing multiple vendors
- More lucrative short-term if you can get buy-in
- Needs relationships with top vendors to replace their account managers
- Jason has network from PMG days - former colleagues at other companies
- Attractive to investors (enterprise = big money)
- Could go fast with right investment partner who has relationships

**Key Insight:** Consulting path = building your way in. Vendor path = waiting for permission.

### The Conglomerate Vision
- One interface for vendors, products, consulting
- AI drafts solutions, humans finish implementations
- Don't automate messy implementation stuff (access, credentials, on-site)
- Trust is everything - makes this an ecosystem not just a marketplace
- Consultants join platform ? serve clients ? build trust ? vendors see distribution ? vendors want in

### Credit Dispute Domain Knowledge
- Jason has domain expertise from PMG pivot to dispute management product
- Not exploring this angle currently but noted for future reference
