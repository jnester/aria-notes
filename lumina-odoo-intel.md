# Lumina / Odoo Intel - Stefan Call Prep

## What Typically Goes Wrong with Odoo Implementations

### Top Failure Patterns (from industry data + Reddit horror stories)
1. **Poor requirements gathering** - jumped in without clear goals, vague "we need automation"
2. **Expensive consultants who burn hours** - one company spent 8K CAD on 150 hours and still didn't have a satisfactory setup
3. **Over-customization too soon** - instead of adapting to Odoo's best practices, they try to force Odoo to match their old workflow
4. **Weak training / low adoption** - users don't know how to use it, generates frustration, people revert to old methods (spreadsheets)
5. **Data migration nightmares** - getting existing data (spreadsheets!) into Odoo cleanly is a massive headache
6. **Lack of internal change management** - resistance to change kills adoption
7. **Upgrade breaking customizations** - Odoo breaks compatibility between versions to modernize codebase, so custom modules and third-party plugins can stop working after upgrades

### Odoo-Specific Complaints (Reddit)
- Consultants are extremely expensive (00+/hr, on par with other ERPs)
- Open source version is limited; enterprise features locked behind paywall
- Documentation is intentionally vague (forces you to pay for support)
- Support burns through purchased hours fast, then upsells more
- "If you can't do it on paper, you won't be able to do it with technology"
- One user: "Using Odoo was an awful experience. I deeply regret it."
- Multiple reports of Odoo removing access to company databases after disputes

### The Real Pattern
Most Odoo failures have nothing to do with Odoo itself — they come from:
- Weak planning
- Unclear requirements
- Rushed customizations
- Skipped testing
- Unrealistic timelines
- 75% of implementation failures caused by poor vendor support or lack of product knowledge

## Jason's Angle / Value Proposition
- **NOT**: "I'll replace Odoo" (too big, too risky)
- **MAYBE**: "I'll help you get Odoo working the way you need it to" (if fixable)
- **OR**: "I'll build targeted automation around Odoo to fill the gaps" (plugins, integrations, AI-powered data entry/extraction)
- **OR**: "Let me help you figure out if Odoo is even the right tool, and if not, what is" (discovery/audit)

## Discovery Questions for Stefan
1. What were you hoping Odoo would do for you?
2. What's it actually doing (or not doing)?
3. Where are the biggest gaps between what you need and what you have?
4. Who set it up? Internal team or external consultants?
5. How much have you spent on implementation so far?
6. What are people still doing in spreadsheets despite having Odoo?
7. What's the most painful manual process right now?
8. Is the team actually using Odoo daily, or are they working around it?

## Mom's Intel
- They hired expensive consultants for Odoo
- They're "overloaded with trying to fix and figure out Odoo problems"
- Denise is the day-to-day spreadsheet manager (feeling the pain)
- Stefan is CRO, built/sold his own business before joining Lumina
- Budget discussions happening for the quarter
- Lumina sells fireplaces + ethanol (to CBD manufacturer)
- Growing fast → spreadsheet breaking down was the original problem

## Pricing Context
- Odoo consultants typically charge 00-150+/hr
- Mom suggested Jason could "charge less" than their current expensive consultants
- Don't undersell — if their consultants are 50/hr, 00-125/hr is competitive AND still good money
- Even 20 hours/month at 00/hr = ,000/month
