# Lumina - Discovery Prep

## Company Context
- Mom's company - fireplaces + ethanol (sells to CBD manufacturer)
- Growing fast → spreadsheets breaking down
- **Denise** = day-to-day spreadsheet manager (feeling the pain)
- **Stefan** = CRO, Alan's son, built/sold own business before joining
- Currently using Odoo - having significant problems with it
- Hired expensive consultants that aren't delivering

## Known Requirements (from earlier conversations)
- Import from existing artifacts (spreadsheets, manufacturer orders)
- Order templates from past orders
- Supplier management per part
- Available inventory view
- Manufacturer tracking
- Products + BOM (bill of materials) per product

## Discovery Questions for Stefan Call
1. What were you hoping Odoo would solve for you?
2. What's it actually doing vs what you expected?
3. Where are the biggest gaps right now?
4. What are your consultants working on? Where are they falling short?
5. What's the day-to-day pain for Denise and the team?
6. Are you self-hosting Odoo or using their cloud service?
7. Which Odoo modules are you using?
8. What's still living in spreadsheets that should be in the system?
9. What's your timeline pressure? Quarter planning, seasonal cycles?
10. What would "fixed" look like to you?

## Approach
- **Listen first. Don't pitch.**
- Let Stefan describe the pain in his own words
- Ask clarifying questions, not leading ones
- Acknowledge challenges honestly
- Position as: "I can help figure out the right solution" not "I'll fix Odoo"
- Could be: fixing Odoo config, building automation around it, custom tooling, or replacing parts

## Pricing Context
- US Odoo consultants: $80-$200/hr (senior: $250+)
- If their consultants charge $150-200/hr, coming in at $100-125/hr is a discount
- Even 20 hrs/month = $2,000-2,500/month
- Don't undersell. Value-based, not desperation-based.
